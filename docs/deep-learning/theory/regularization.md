# Regularization Techniques

## Introduction

Regularization techniques help prevent overfitting by constraining the model's capacity or adding penalties to the loss function.

## Content Coming Soon

This section will cover:

- L1 and L2 regularization
- Dropout and its variants
- Early stopping
- Data augmentation
- Batch normalization
- Weight decay
- Label smoothing
- Mixup and CutMix

## Quick Reference

### Common Regularization Methods

- **L1 (Lasso)**: Promotes sparsity, feature selection
- **L2 (Ridge)**: Prevents large weights, better generalization
- **Dropout**: Randomly deactivates neurons during training
- **Batch Norm**: Normalizes activations, stabilizes training
- **Data Augmentation**: Increases effective dataset size

### When to Use

- **L1**: When you want feature selection
- **L2**: General purpose, good default
- **Dropout**: For overfitting prevention
- **Batch Norm**: For training stability
- **Data Aug**: When you have limited data
