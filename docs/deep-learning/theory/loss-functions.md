# Loss Functions

## Introduction

Loss functions measure how well a model's predictions match the true targets. They are the objective functions that optimization algorithms try to minimize.

## Content Coming Soon

This section will cover:

- Regression losses (MSE, MAE, Huber)
- Classification losses (Cross-entropy, Focal Loss)
- Ranking losses (Triplet Loss, Contrastive Loss)
- Custom loss functions
- Loss function selection criteria
- Multi-task learning losses

## Quick Reference

### Common Loss Functions

**Regression:**
- **MSE**: Mean squared error, sensitive to outliers
- **MAE**: Mean absolute error, robust to outliers
- **Huber**: Combines MSE and MAE benefits

**Classification:**
- **Cross-entropy**: Standard for classification
- **Focal Loss**: Handles class imbalance
- **Hinge Loss**: For SVM-like models

**Specialized:**
- **Triplet Loss**: For similarity learning
- **Contrastive Loss**: For embedding learning

### Selection Guidelines

- **Regression**: Start with MSE, use MAE for robustness
- **Classification**: Use cross-entropy with softmax
- **Imbalanced data**: Consider focal loss
- **Custom problems**: Design task-specific losses
