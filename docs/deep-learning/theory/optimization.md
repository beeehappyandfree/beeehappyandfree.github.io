# Optimization Algorithms

## Introduction

Optimization algorithms are crucial for training neural networks effectively. They determine how model parameters are updated during training to minimize the loss function.

This section will cover:

- Gradient Descent variants (SGD, Mini-batch, Batch)
- Momentum and Nesterov Momentum
- Adaptive methods (Adam, RMSprop, AdaGrad)
- Learning rate scheduling
- Second-order methods
- Practical considerations and best practices

## Quick Reference

### Common Optimizers

- **SGD**: Basic gradient descent
- **Adam**: Adaptive learning rates, good default choice
- **RMSprop**: Adaptive learning rates per parameter
- **Momentum**: Accelerates convergence in relevant directions

### Learning Rate Scheduling

- **Step decay**: Reduce by factor every N epochs
- **Exponential decay**: Continuous reduction
- **Cosine annealing**: Smooth periodic reduction
- **Warmup**: Start small, increase, then decrease
