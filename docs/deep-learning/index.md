# Deep Learning Study Notes

Welcome to the comprehensive deep learning study guide! This section is organized to help you build a solid foundation in deep learning, from theoretical concepts to practical implementation and interview preparation.

## ðŸ“š Study Path

### 1. Theory & Fundamentals
Start here to understand the core concepts of deep learning:
- [Neural Network Basics](./theory/neural-networks.md)
- [Activation Functions](./theory/activation-functions.md)
- [Optimization Algorithms](./theory/optimization.md)
- [Regularization Techniques](./theory/regularization.md)
- [Loss Functions](./theory/loss-functions.md)

### 2. Mathematics
Build mathematical intuition and understanding:
- [Linear Algebra Foundations](./mathematics/linear-algebra.md)
- [Calculus & Gradients](./mathematics/calculus.md)
- [Probability & Statistics](./mathematics/probability.md)
- [Information Theory](./mathematics/information-theory.md)

### 3. Infrastructure & Engineering
Learn about production deployment and scaling:
- [Model Deployment](./infrastructure/deployment.md)
- [Scalability & Performance](./infrastructure/scalability.md)
- [MLOps Best Practices](./infrastructure/mlops.md)
- [Hardware Considerations](./infrastructure/hardware.md)

### 4. Interview Preparation
Test and reinforce your knowledge:
- [Common Interview Questions](./interviews/common-questions.md)
- [Problem-Solving Approaches](./interviews/problem-solving.md)
- [System Design Scenarios](./interviews/system-design.md)
- [Implementation Challenges](./interviews/implementation.md)

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

By the end of this study guide, you should be able to:

- **Understand** the theoretical foundations of deep learning
