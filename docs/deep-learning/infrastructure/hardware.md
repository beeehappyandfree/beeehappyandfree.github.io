## Quick Reference

### Processing Units

**CPU (Central Processing Unit):**
- General-purpose processing
- Good for data preprocessing
- Limited parallel processing

**GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):**
- Massive parallel processing
- Excellent for matrix operations
- High memory bandwidth
- NVIDIA CUDA ecosystem

**TPU (Tensor Processing Unit):**
- Google's specialized ASIC
- Optimized for TensorFlow
- High throughput for inference

### Memory Considerations

- **VRAM**: GPU memory for model weights and activations
- **System RAM**: For data loading and preprocessing
- **Storage**: SSD vs HDD for data access speed
- **Memory Hierarchy**: Cache, RAM, storage trade-offs

### Cloud vs On-Premise

**Cloud Advantages:**
- Scalability and flexibility
- No hardware maintenance
- Pay-per-use pricing
- Latest hardware access

**On-Premise Advantages:**
- Data privacy and security
- Predictable costs
- No network latency
- Full control over infrastructure
