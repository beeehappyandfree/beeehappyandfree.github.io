# Scalability & Performance

## Introduction

Scalability and performance are critical considerations when deploying deep learning models in production. This involves optimizing for throughput, latency, and resource utilization.

## Content Coming Soon

This section will cover:

- Horizontal vs vertical scaling
- Load balancing strategies
- Caching and optimization
- Database scaling
- Microservices architecture
- Performance monitoring
- Cost optimization

## Quick Reference

### Scaling Strategies

**Horizontal Scaling:**
- Add more machines/servers
- Load balancing across instances
- Stateless design principles

**Vertical Scaling:**
- Increase resources per machine
- CPU, memory, GPU upgrades
- Limited by hardware constraints

### Performance Optimization

- **Caching**: Redis, in-memory caching
- **CDN**: Content delivery networks
- **Database**: Read replicas, sharding
- **Async Processing**: Background jobs
- **Compression**: Model and data compression

### Monitoring Metrics

- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Latency**: Response time (P50, P95, P99)
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, GPU
- **Error Rates**: Failed requests percentage
- **Cost**: Per-request cost analysis
