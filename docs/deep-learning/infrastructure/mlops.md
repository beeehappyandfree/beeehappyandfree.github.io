# MLOps Best Practices

## Introduction

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) combines ML, DevOps, and data engineering to streamline the development, deployment, and maintenance of machine learning models in production.

## Content Coming Soon

This section will cover:

- CI/CD for ML pipelines
- Model versioning and management
- Data versioning and lineage
- Experiment tracking
- Model monitoring and drift detection
- Automated retraining
- Infrastructure as code

## Quick Reference

### MLOps Components

**Development:**
- Version control for code and data
- Experiment tracking (MLflow, Weights & Biases)
- Automated testing and validation

**Deployment:**
- Model serving and API management
- A/B testing and canary deployments
- Rollback strategies

**Monitoring:**
- Model performance tracking
- Data drift detection
- Infrastructure monitoring

### Tools and Platforms

- **Experiment Tracking**: MLflow, Weights & Biases, Neptune
- **Model Serving**: TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, Seldon
- **Orchestration**: Kubeflow, Airflow, Prefect
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Evidently
- **Version Control**: DVC, Git LFS, Model Registry

### Best Practices

- **Reproducibility**: Deterministic training pipelines
- **Automation**: Automated testing and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Continuous model performance tracking
- **Documentation**: Clear model and pipeline documentation
- **Security**: Secure model serving and data handling
