# Information Theory

## Introduction

Information theory provides mathematical tools for quantifying information, uncertainty, and communication. It's fundamental to understanding entropy, mutual information, and compression in deep learning.

## Content Coming Soon

This section will cover:

- Entropy and information content
- Mutual information and KL divergence
- Cross-entropy and its applications
- Data compression and encoding
- Rate-distortion theory
- Information bottleneck principle
- Applications in deep learning

## Quick Reference

### Key Concepts

- **Entropy**: Measure of uncertainty or randomness
- **Information**: Reduction in uncertainty
- **Mutual Information**: Shared information between variables
- **KL Divergence**: Measure of difference between distributions
- **Cross-entropy**: Measure of prediction quality

### Formulas

- **Entropy**: H(X) = -Σ p(x) log p(x)
- **Cross-entropy**: H(p,q) = -Σ p(x) log q(x)
- **KL Divergence**: D_KL(P||Q) = Σ p(x) log(p(x)/q(x))
- **Mutual Information**: I(X;Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y)

### Applications in Deep Learning

- **Loss Functions**: Cross-entropy for classification
- **Model Compression**: Information bottleneck
- **Feature Selection**: Mutual information
- **Generative Models**: KL divergence in VAEs
- **Regularization**: Information-based constraints
