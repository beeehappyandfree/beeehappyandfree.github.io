# Calculus & Gradients

## Introduction

Calculus is fundamental to understanding how neural networks learn. Gradients, derivatives, and optimization are core concepts in deep learning.

## Content Coming Soon

This section will cover:

- Derivatives and partial derivatives
- Chain rule and its applications
- Gradient computation
- Backpropagation mathematics
- Hessian matrices and second derivatives
- Automatic differentiation
- Gradient flow analysis

## Quick Reference

### Key Concepts

- **Derivative**: Rate of change of a function
- **Partial Derivative**: Derivative with respect to one variable
- **Gradient**: Vector of partial derivatives
- **Chain Rule**: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)

### Applications in Deep Learning

- **Backpropagation**: Uses chain rule to compute gradients
- **Optimization**: Gradients guide parameter updates
- **Gradient Descent**: Follows negative gradient direction
- **Vanishing/Exploding Gradients**: Common training problems

### Common Derivatives

- **Linear**: d/dx(ax + b) = a
- **Power**: d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)
- **Exponential**: d/dx(e^x) = e^x
- **Logarithm**: d/dx(ln(x)) = 1/x
