# Probability & Statistics

## Introduction

Probability and statistics provide the mathematical foundation for understanding uncertainty, making predictions, and evaluating model performance in deep learning.

## Content Coming Soon

This section will cover:

- Probability fundamentals
- Random variables and distributions
- Bayes' theorem and Bayesian inference
- Statistical inference and hypothesis testing
- Maximum likelihood estimation
- Bayesian neural networks
- Uncertainty quantification

## Quick Reference

### Key Concepts

- **Probability**: Measure of likelihood of events
- **Random Variable**: Variable with probabilistic outcomes
- **Distribution**: Function describing probability of outcomes
- **Expectation**: Average value of a random variable
- **Variance**: Measure of spread around the mean

### Common Distributions

- **Normal/Gaussian**: Bell-shaped, symmetric
- **Bernoulli**: Binary outcomes (0 or 1)
- **Binomial**: Number of successes in n trials
- **Poisson**: Count of rare events
- **Exponential**: Time between events

### Applications in Deep Learning

- **Loss Functions**: Often based on probability distributions
- **Bayesian Inference**: Uncertainty quantification
- **Generative Models**: Modeling data distributions
- **Model Evaluation**: Statistical significance testing
