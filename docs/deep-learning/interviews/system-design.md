# System Design Scenarios

## Introduction

System design interviews test your ability to design scalable, reliable, and efficient systems. This section covers common ML system design scenarios and approaches.

## Content Coming Soon

This section will cover:

- System design methodology
- Scalability patterns
- Data pipeline design
- Model serving architectures
- Real-time vs batch processing
- Fault tolerance and reliability
- Cost optimization strategies

## Quick Reference

### System Design Framework

**1. Requirements Clarification:**
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements (scale, latency, availability)
- Constraints and assumptions

**2. High-Level Design:**
- System components and interactions
- Data flow and storage
- API design

**3. Detailed Design:**
- Database schema
- Caching strategies
- Load balancing
- Security considerations

**4. Trade-offs and Optimization:**
- Performance vs cost
- Consistency vs availability
- Latency vs throughput

### Common ML System Components

- **Data Ingestion**: Stream processing, batch processing
- **Feature Store**: Real-time feature serving
- **Model Training**: Distributed training pipelines
- **Model Serving**: Inference APIs, A/B testing
- **Monitoring**: Performance tracking, alerting

### Design Patterns

- **Microservices**: Independent, scalable services
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous processing
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation
- **Event Sourcing**: Append-only event logs
