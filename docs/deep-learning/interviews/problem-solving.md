- Trade-off analysis
- Communication strategies

## Quick Reference

### Problem-Solving Framework

**1. Understand the Problem:**
- Clarify requirements and constraints
- Identify key components and relationships
- Ask clarifying questions

**2. Break Down the Problem:**
- Decompose into smaller subproblems
- Identify dependencies and order
- Consider edge cases

**3. Design Solution:**
- Choose appropriate algorithms/architectures
- Consider trade-offs (accuracy vs speed vs memory)
- Plan implementation steps

**4. Implement and Test:**
- Write clean, readable code
- Test with simple cases first
- Validate assumptions

### Common Patterns

- **Divide and Conquer**: Break into smaller problems
- **Dynamic Programming**: Build solutions incrementally
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Make locally optimal choices
- **Backtracking**: Try different paths systematically

### Communication Tips

- **Think aloud**: Explain your reasoning process
- **Start simple**: Begin with basic solutions
- **Discuss trade-offs**: Consider multiple approaches
- **Ask questions**: Clarify requirements when needed
