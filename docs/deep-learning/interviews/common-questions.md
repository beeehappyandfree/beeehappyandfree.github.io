# Common Interview Questions

## Theory & Fundamentals

### 1. What is the difference between machine learning and deep learning?

**Answer:**
- **Machine Learning**: Uses algorithms to learn patterns from data, often with hand-engineered features
- **Deep Learning**: Subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to automatically learn hierarchical representations

**Key Differences:**
- Feature engineering: ML requires manual feature engineering, DL learns features automatically
- Data requirements: DL typically needs more data
- Computational requirements: DL requires more computational power
- Interpretability: ML models are often more interpretable

### 2. Explain backpropagation in your own words.

**Answer:**
Backpropagation is an algorithm for computing gradients in neural networks:

1. **Forward Pass**: Compute predictions and loss
2. **Backward Pass**: Calculate gradients using chain rule
3. **Weight Update**: Update weights using gradients and learning rate

**Key Insight**: The chain rule allows us to efficiently compute gradients for all parameters by working backwards from the loss.

### 3. What is the vanishing gradient problem?

**Answer:**
The vanishing gradient problem occurs when gradients become extremely small as they propagate backward through layers, causing early layers to learn very slowly.

**Causes:**
- Sigmoid/tanh activation functions saturate
- Deep networks with many layers
- Poor weight initialization

**Solutions:**
- Use ReLU activation functions
- Proper weight initialization (Xavier/He)
- Batch normalization
- Residual connections

### 4. What is overfitting and how do you prevent it?

**Answer:**
Overfitting occurs when a model performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data.

**Signs:**
- High training accuracy, low validation accuracy
- Large gap between training and validation loss

**Prevention Methods:**
- **Regularization**: L1/L2 regularization, dropout
- **Data augmentation**: Increase training data variety
- **Early stopping**: Stop training when validation loss increases
- **Cross-validation**: Ensure robust evaluation
- **Model simplification**: Reduce model complexity

### 5. Explain the difference between batch, mini-batch, and stochastic gradient descent.

**Answer:**
- **Batch GD**: Uses entire dataset for each update
  - Pros: Stable convergence, true gradient direction
  - Cons: Memory intensive, slow for large datasets

- **Mini-batch GD**: Uses subset of data (e.g., 32, 64, 128 samples)
  - Pros: Balance of stability and speed, parallelizable
  - Cons: Introduces noise in gradients

- **Stochastic GD**: Uses single sample per update
  - Pros: Fast updates, can escape local minima
  - Cons: High variance, noisy gradients

## Mathematics

### 6. What is the chain rule and why is it important in deep learning?

**Answer:**
The chain rule states that for composite functions:
```
d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) * g'(x)
```

**Importance in DL:**
- Enables efficient gradient computation in neural networks
- Allows backpropagation to work
- Essential for training deep networks

**Example:**
For a neural network with loss L and output y:
```
∂L/∂w = ∂L/∂y * ∂y/∂z * ∂z/∂w
```

### 7. Explain the concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

**Answer:**
For a square matrix A, if Av = λv, then:
- λ is an eigenvalue (scalar)
- v is an eigenvector (vector)

**Geometric Interpretation:**
- Eigenvectors point in directions that don't change when matrix is applied
- Eigenvalues indicate scaling factor in those directions

**Applications in DL:**
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Understanding model dynamics
- Matrix decomposition

### 8. What is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization?

**Answer:**
- **L1 (Lasso)**: Adds λ * Σ|wᵢ| to loss function
  - Promotes sparsity (many zero weights)
  - Feature selection effect
  - Less sensitive to outliers

- **L2 (Ridge)**: Adds λ * Σwᵢ² to loss function
  - Prevents large weights
  - Better generalization
  - More stable training

**Visual Difference:**
- L1 creates diamond-shaped constraint region
- L2 creates circular constraint region

## Optimization

### 9. Compare different optimization algorithms.

**Answer:**

**SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent):**
- Simple, widely used
- Requires careful learning rate tuning
- Can get stuck in local minima

**Adam:**
- Adaptive learning rates
- Good default choice
- Combines benefits of RMSprop and momentum

**RMSprop:**
- Adapts learning rate per parameter
- Good for non-stationary problems
- Less sensitive to learning rate choice

**Momentum:**
- Accelerates convergence
- Helps escape local minima
- Reduces oscillation

### 10. What is learning rate scheduling?

**Answer:**
Learning rate scheduling adjusts the learning rate during training.

**Common Strategies:**
- **Step decay**: Reduce by factor every N epochs
- **Exponential decay**: Continuous reduction
- **Cosine annealing**: Smooth periodic reduction
- **Warmup**: Start small, increase, then decrease

**Benefits:**
- Faster convergence
- Better final performance
- Stability in training

## Neural Network Architectures

### 11. What are the advantages of CNNs over fully connected networks for image processing?

**Answer:**
- **Parameter sharing**: Same filters applied across image
- **Local connectivity**: Each neuron only sees local region
- **Translation invariance**: Recognizes patterns regardless of location
- **Hierarchical features**: Learns edges → textures → objects
- **Computational efficiency**: Fewer parameters than FC networks

### 12. Explain the concept of attention mechanisms.

**Answer:**
Attention allows models to focus on relevant parts of input when making predictions.

**Key Components:**
- **Query (Q)**: What we're looking for
- **Key (K)**: What's available
- **Value (V)**: Actual content

**Attention Formula:**
```
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V
```

**Applications:**
- Transformer models
- Neural machine translation
- Image captioning

### 13. What is the difference between RNNs and LSTMs?

**Answer:**
**RNNs:**
- Simple recurrent structure
- Suffers from vanishing/exploding gradients
- Limited memory capacity

**LSTMs:**
- Complex gating mechanism (input, forget, output gates)
- Better gradient flow
- Long-term memory capability
- Cell state for information preservation

## Implementation

    def forward(self, predictions, targets):
        # Example: Custom MSE with weighting
        loss = torch.mean((predictions - targets) ** 2)
        return loss

# Usage
criterion = CustomLoss()
loss = criterion(predictions, targets)
```
